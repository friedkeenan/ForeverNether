# ForeverNether
A Minecraft data pack that keeps players stuck within the nether

To begin the imprisonment, you have to die (I recommend using the `/kill` command). You will then be moved to the nether and you will be trapped there. When you first enter the nether, you will be given two grass blocks and an oak sapling, what you do after that is up to you.

This was tested on version 1.13.2.
